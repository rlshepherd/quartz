> A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren&#39;t strictly organised by their publication date. They&#39;re inherently exploratory â€“ notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren&#39;t refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They&#39;re less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we&#39;re used to seeing.
