# SPAE: Semantic Pyramid AutoEncoder for Multimodal Generation with Frozen LLMs

In this work, we introduce Semantic Pyramid AutoEncoder (SPAE) for enabling
frozen LLMs to perform both understanding and generation tasks involving
non-linguistic modalities such as images or videos. SPAE converts between raw
pixels and interpretable lexical tokens (or words) extracted from the LLM&#39;s
vocabulary. The resulting tokens capture both the semantic meaning and the
fine-grained details needed for visual reconstruction, effectively translating
the visual content into a language comprehensible to the LLM, and empowering it
to perform a wide array of multimodal tasks. Our approach is validated through
in-context learning experiments with frozen PaLM 2 and GPT 3.5 on a diverse set
of image understanding and generation tasks. Our method marks the first
successful attempt to enable a frozen LLM to generate image content while
surpassing state-of-the-art performance in image understanding tasks, under the
same setting, by over 25%.
